## Usage
`campfire.lua [path to file]`

Use the arrow keys to navigate from page to page, or the on screen buttons if you're using an advanced non-monitor. The filename will display at the top, and the current page and total page count will display at the bottom.

Files of any length should work, to a reasonable degree.

## Known Issues
The on screen buttons don't display or function on monitors.

## Planned Features
Color support, using the old Minecraft color code system. Type &6 and the text after will be gold until you change it or reset it with &r.

A special marker to force a page break. This'll come with color support, since the system to detect symbols is the same for both.

Some kind of file picking menu, for when a file isn't passed through.
